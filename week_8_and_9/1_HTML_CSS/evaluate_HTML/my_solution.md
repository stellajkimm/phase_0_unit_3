## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.

Hacker news likes to put css properties into the html file, which we learned is not good practice.  All presentation properties should be located in a separate file.
 
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 

there were ID's for links but they weren't in the CSS.  I asked a tutor about this and he says it doesn't have to be in the css because it has some other file or something like that.

Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.

Using all tables within tables within tables is confusing for me.  I feel like there could be a better way.  I wish they did a better naming convention.  For example, when it comes to the nav, they should have used a nav div.
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.

The authors formatted the site with both the HTML and CSS files.  For the most part, they used the CSS for classes, and all tables, table rows, etc, they added presentation in the HTML.
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?

I didn't understand why thre were so many IDs but no ID information in the css.  I asked my tutor about this and he explained it to me but I don't really understand/remember what he said about it.  I will ahve to ask again.
 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?

It is not DRY.  There are many properties that are repeating itself such as the font name and font color of specific classes.
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?

There is no responsive design in the site because it is unnecessary.  The site is basically a list all the way down the page so there is no need to change the layout for different browser sizes.
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?

I think it needs some work.  There are a lot of ways that it can be better.
