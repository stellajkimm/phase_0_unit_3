I worked with Sid Patel in this challenge. This was a fairly easy challenge.  It was pretty much like last week's work except I didn't know how to add foreign keys to the table when you create a table.  We worked through that together.  Another thing that we didn't exactly know how to do is make a select statement with 3 tables.  We researched this and found the answer fairly quickly as well.
