## Release 5: Reflection

# To be completely honest, I can't grasp what the color joins mean and I can't find a source where
# it can tell me what it means.  I understand conceptually what it means, but I don't understand how
# to identify them in the SQL Designer.  I will have to go to office hours for this.
