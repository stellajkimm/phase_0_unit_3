# U3.W7: SQLZoo for SQL Queries

## Learning Competencies
- Write simple SELECT statements to extract data from one or more fields on a single table using the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY keywords


## Summary
In this challenge, you will dive in to SQL - Structured Query Language for databases.  If you are new to SQL and databases, make sure to watch some of the videos listed on the [Week 7 Readme](../readme.md).

## Release 0: Go to [SQLzoo](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page)
Start the first set of exercises "SELECT basics".  Complete this set and complete the quiz that is linked to at the bottom. **DO NOT CREATE AN ACCOUNT FIRST - There is an annoying bug in SQLZoo.**


## Release 1: OPTIONAL: [Create an account](http://sqlzoo.net/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Main+Page&type=signup)
Now you are able to create an account so you can save your quiz results and return to SQLzoo whenever you want.  Choose "local" as your domain.  (NOTE: you need to complete some SQL questions before you can create an account.  

Sometimes SQL Zoo is super buggy when it comes to making an account. If you are having problems, just take screenshots of your quizzes as you go. 

## Release 2: Complete the following sections along with their quizzes:  

* 2 SELECT from World
* 3 SELECT from Nobel (the quiz for this section is not mandatory)
* 5 SUM and COUNT
* 6 JOIN (#8-13 of the tutorial is **BONUS**!)

You will need to do some research as you go. The tutorial is more meant to get you to experiment and try queries. It's not really intended to teach. So this is a good time to amp up your researching skills! [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) is a pretty good reference.

## Release 3: Save your Quiz Results
When you are finished, access your quiz results by going to your profile page (link is in the upper right corner). Take a screenshot of the scores and results, rename it to `sqlzoo_quiz.jpg`, and saving it in the [imgs](../imgs) directory in this repository. THEN, add the image (inline using markdown) into your [my_quizzes.md](my_quizzes.md) file in this directory. 

## Release 4: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/reflection_guidelines.md) in the reflection section of your [my_quizzes.md](my_quizzes.md) file. 

## Release 5: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/review.md) 
2 of your accountability group member's solutions. Make sure to leave them feedback as an issue on their repo! Make sure they have "issues" set up as features. If they don't help them set it up! 

## Optimize Your Learning: 
Dive into the other sections!  Follow the tutorials and take the quizzes to deepen your SQL skills.


#### Troubleshooting Profile Creation
If you're getting error messages trying to create a profile and you're not sure why, try this:
1. Do a lesson and complete the quiz
2. Submit the quiz
3. Now create a new account. For "Your Domain" select "local".ï»¿
